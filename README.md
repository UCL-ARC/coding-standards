# Research Software Good Practices and Coding Standards

These are the default good practices, style decisions, and standards for
research software engineering projects used by the Centre for Advanced Research
Computing at UCL.
They act as our default choices, general guidelines, and recommendations.

We encourage that our projects follow these recommendations if there are no other constraints, and if you are working with us, we may have pointed you to this page (ðŸ‘‹).
