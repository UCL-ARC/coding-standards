# UCL-ARC RSE Community Handbook

These are the default good practices, style decisions, and standards for
research software engineering projects used by the Centre for Advanced Research
Computing at UCL and act as UCL-ARC RSE community's default choices, general guidelines and recommendations.

We encourage that our projects follow these recommendations if there are no other constraints, and if you are working with us, we may have pointed you to this page (👋).

In the best case, this means that there is only one standard to learn per
language. We hope this results in:
  * 🛠️ a more consistent tooling and setup,
  * 😊 less time thinking about style,
  * 💪 faster onboarding of staff to new projects, and
  * 🚀 faster review of code.

We acknowledge that neutral choices can be arbitrary, but good choices improve
readability. As for the arbitrary ones, well, we take the view that we'd rather
not expend mental energy thinking about them.

Exceptions to these standards are usually along the lines of "there is already
an established local standard". And that's _**great**_. If someone has already
thought about coding style then the last thing we want to do is waste that
effort by needlessly changing to another set of standards.
