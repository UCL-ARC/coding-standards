# C++

C++ and C code should conform to the [Google coding conventions](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) in terms of variable names and layout.

We will use [C++11](](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++11)) features including range-based for loops and lambda expressions where this improves readability.
