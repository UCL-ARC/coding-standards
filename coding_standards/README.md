# Coding Standards

In the best case, there should be only one standard to learn per
language. We hope this results in:
  * 🛠️ a more consistent tooling and setup,
  * 😊 less time thinking about style,
  * 💪 faster onboarding of staff to new projects, and
  * 🚀 faster review of code.

We acknowledge that neutral choices can be arbitrary, but good choices improve
readability. As for the arbitrary ones, well, we take the view that we'd rather
not expend mental energy thinking about them.

Exceptions to these standards are usually along the lines of "there is already
an established local standard". And that's _**great**_. If someone has already
thought about coding style then the last thing we want to do is waste that
effort by needlessly changing to another set of standards.


## Coding standards by language:

  * [C++](./c++)
  * [Python](./python)
  * [R](./r)
