# C++

C++ and C code should conform to [ISO C++](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines) with the
[Google style conventions](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) _in terms of variable and class names, and
layout_.

<details><summary>Style conflicts</summary>

We choose to follow the ISO guidelines where a Google-specific decision conflicts with the ISO.

The main example of this is the
[recommendation to throw exceptions](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Re-throw), which is
discouraged by Google. As this is recommended by ISO and not related to naming we shall throw exceptions.

</details>

We will use modern C++ features - including range-based for loops and lambda expressions - where this improves
readability. This means we prefer to work with [C++11](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++11),
[C++17](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++17), or newer.

We use the [clang-tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/) linter configured to obey Google style. That is:

```sh
clang-tidy  --format-style='google'
```

We also recommend using [cppcheck](https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint), a
[static analyser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis). It can be helpful to improve code quality in
general.

Our preferred build system for C++ code projects is [CMake](https://cmake.org/).
