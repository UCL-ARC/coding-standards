# Python

Python code will adhere to the [PEP8](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) Python coding standard.

* As a minimum we will support the last 42 months of Python releases. This has been adopted by the wider scientific Python community and codified in [Numpy Enhancement Proposal 29](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html). If researchers require specific support for older versions of Python this can be offered.
* We have [separate web pages to document our Python recommendations](https://ucl-arc.github.io/python-tooling/) and we maintain an [ARC-recommended `cookieninja` template](https://github.com/UCL-ARC/python-tooling), which might be a helpful starting point.
